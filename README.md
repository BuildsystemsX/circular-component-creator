# üèóÔ∏è Circular Component Creator

* Comparison section with properties like GWP/m¬≤ and U-Value. The user can put side-by-side the building components from the catalog.
* Creator section where the users can create their own components, adding layers, changing the material and its thickness.
* In the final section the users can compare their creations to the components available on the database.
